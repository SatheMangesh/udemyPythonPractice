Numbers: Simple Arithmetic
Write an expression that equals 100. 
"""

print(25*4)
print(50+50)
print(200/2)

"""
Use what you know about the print() function to print out the phrase "Hello World" . Make sure your capitalization and spacing match.
"""

print("Hello World")


"""
String Indexing
Write a string index that returns just the letter 'r'  from 'Hello World' .

For example, 'Hello World'[0]  returns 'H' 
"""

mystr = 'Hello World'
print(mystr[8])

"""
String Slicing
Use string slicing to grab the word 'ink'  from inside 'tinker' 

For example, 'education'[3:6]  returns 'cat' 

Remember that when slicing you only go up to but not including the end index.
"""

mystring = 'tinker'
print(mystring[1:4:])

""""
Print Formatting
Write an expression using any of the string formatting methods we have learned (except f-strings, see note below) to return the phrase 'Python rules!' 

For example, these phrases both return 'I like apples' :

'I like %s' %'apples'
'I like {}'.format('apples')
Your solution should be entered on one line. You can not use variable names, only the strings themselves.

"""

""""
Lists
Create a list that contains at least one string, one integer and one float.

For example:

[1, 'two', 3.14159] 

Note that the order and number of items doesn't matter. 
"""

mystring = ['a',100,67.88]

"""
Dictionaries
Create a dictionary where all the keys are strings, and all the values are integers.

For example:

{'Monday':19, 'Tuesday':20}

Just write the dictionary on a single line, don't assign a variable name to the dictionary.
"""


mydict = {'planets':9, 'constolessions' : 27, 'signs':12}

"""
Sets
Write an expression that would turn the string 'Mississippi'  into a set of unique letters.

For example:

set('Parallel') 

would return the set {'P', 'a', 'e', 'l', 'r'}

You should only write one line of code for this. Do not assign a variable name to the set.

"""
File I/O
This exercise will require several lines of code.

Write a script that opens a file named 'test.txt' , writes 'Hello World'  to the file, then closes it.

For example, the following code opens a file called 'myfile.txt' , writes 'This is my file' , and closes it:

x = open('myfile.txt', 'w')
x.write('This is my file')
x.close()
